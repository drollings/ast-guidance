Here is a complete, standalone Contributor License Agreement (CLA) template designed specifically for a dual-licensed project. It ensures you secure the irrevocable right to use community code in your commercial, closed-source offering.

You can save this as a CLA.md file in your repository or plug it directly into an automated tool like CLA Assistant.

Disclaimer: I am an AI, not an attorney. This is a structural template based on industry standards (like the Apache and Harmony CLAs) tailored for dual-licensing. You should have a legal professional review it to ensure it meets the specific requirements of your jurisdiction.

Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")
Thank you for your interest in contributing to [ast-guidance] ("AST Guidance"). In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, [Your Name/Company Name] ("Licensor") must have a Contributor License Agreement on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below.

This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Licensor and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

Please read this document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records.

1. Definitions
"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with the Licensor.

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Licensor for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the Licensor (the "Work").

"Submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor.

2. Grant of Copyright License
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Licensor and to recipients of software distributed by the Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works. This explicitly includes the right for the Licensor to re-license and distribute Your Contributions under commercial, proprietary, or alternative open-source licenses.

3. Grant of Patent License
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Licensor and to recipients of software distributed by the Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work.

4. Ownership and Moral Rights
You retain full ownership of the copyright in Your Contribution and have the same rights to use or license the Contribution which You would have had without entering into this Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, You also waive any moral rights or equivalent rights you may have in the Contribution that would restrict the Licensor's ability to utilize the Contribution as outlined in this Agreement.

5. Representation of Rights
You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to the Licensor, or that Your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Licensor.

6. Original Creation
You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You agree to notify the Licensor of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

7. Support and Warranty Disclaimer
You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
